#bitsBrewers is my first attempt at bringing a c# data driven program to a user interface. I have decided to continue this application and develop a complete nanobrewery inventory tracking system. It could be adapted to any small business and thus has practical applications. This is also a good project to continue to develop my c#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills as I continue to develop as a programmer. The current use case I am developing is selecting a recipe to add to the brew schedule, next will be the actual scheduling. While I created the UI template design, I do not own the logo that is property of Manifest Brewing Company in Eugene Oregon.
